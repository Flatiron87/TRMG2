<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Caliper performed a number of sensitivity tests to ensure that the model responds reasonably to changes in inputs. Changes were made to income, the transit network, the all-streets non-motorized network, highway network capacities and tolls, and parking supply and cost. All these tests indicate that the model is responding reasonably to input changes and is appropriately sensitive. Each of the tests conducted are documented below.</p>
</div>
<div id="increased-income" class="section level2">
<h2>Increased Income</h2>
<ul>
<li>No build scenario: 2020 Base Year</li>
<li>Build scenario: 2020 Base Year + increased income in south Durham</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, Caliper tested a simple increase of income in the area of south Durham highlighted in the map below. The household income for this entire area was increased to $120,000, and the percentage of high income workers was adjusted to 70%. The resulting increases in auto ownership, trip-making, auto and particularly SOV mode shares, and VMT and VHT were reasonable.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/IncomeIncreaseArea.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="auto-ownership-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Auto Ownership Changes</h3>
<p>The first change resulting from the increased income was an increase in automobile ownership. The total automobiles owned in these zones increased by 2,544 from 11,477 to 14,021. This equates to an increase in average auto ownership from 1.38 cars/household to 1.68 cars/household in these zones.</p>
</div>
<div id="hb-trip-production-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>HB Trip Production Changes</h3>
<p>In response to the direct effect of income and the indirect effect of auto ownership, trip production increased for every trip type. The total number of work trips (W_HB_W) increased the least (since the number of workers did not increase, just their income) and long activity discretionary activities (N_HB_OD_Long) increased the most. The total home-based trips in the affected zones increased by 14.7% from 48,986 to 56,169.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-motorized-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Motorized Changes</h3>
<p>Despite the overall increase in HB trips, the increase in income and consequently vehicle ownership led to a slight (2.5%) decrease in home-based (HB) non-motorized trips from 5,429 to 5,293. The overall increase in trip-making was large enough for some purposes (such as discretionary) that non-motorized trips increased slightly for these purposes (although they decreased as a mode share), but this was more than offset primarily by less people walking for shopping, eating out (OME), and work. The increase in overall HB trips also led to an increase in NHB trips, including non-motorized trips. The increase of 127 non-home-based non-motorized trips results in a net loss of only 29 total non-motorized trips.</p>
</div>
<div id="mode-choice-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Mode Choice Changes</h3>
<p>The increases in income and auto ownership also led to HB mode shifts. Transit trips decreased by slightly more than half from 1,726 to 814. Auto trips increased overall and also shifted towards SOV comprising 46% of HB trips for the subarea in the base case and 50% in the scenario, resulting in more vehicle trips from the subarea.</p>
</div>
<div id="nhb-trip-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>NHB Trip Changes</h3>
<p>The increase of HB auto trips also led to an increase in non-home-based (NHB) auto trips of 4,270 trips. However, NHB auto_pay trips decreased by 53 trips, and transit NHB trips decreased by 368 trips.</p>
</div>
<div id="highway-assignment-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Highway Assignment Changes</h3>
<p>The increased vehicle trips resulted in an increase of 59,071 VMT (0.10% regional increase), 1,551 VHT (0.12% regional increase), and 170 more vehicle hours of delay (0.38% increase). As can be seen in the following map, the increases were largest in the area of south Durham with the increased income, but most all of Durham saw increased traffic and some increases reached as far as Raleigh.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/IncomeAssignment.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="new-bus-route" class="section level2">
<h2>New Bus Route</h2>
<ul>
<li>No Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year</li>
<li>Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year + added bus route</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, Caliper tested adding a new bus route. A route was added in north Raleigh from the Crabtree Valley mall up Creedmoor, Millbrook, and Leesville roads and ending at a large quarry. The new route can be seen in green in the map below. 30- and 60-minute headways were assumed for peak and off-peak periods respectively.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/NewBusRoute.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The model’s results were reasonable, predicting a daily ridership on the new route of 509 passengers similar to the ridership of existing GoRaleigh route 23L which is similar in length with one end at Crabtree Valley Mall.</p>
<div id="auto-ownership-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Auto Ownership Changes</h3>
<p>The first change in the model in response to the new bus route is a decrease in auto ownership near the route. The auto ownership in the zones affected by the new route decreased from 1.635 cars/household to 1.625 cars/household, a 0.6% decrease in autos owned in the corridor.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/BusAutosChange.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="hb-trip-production-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>HB Trip Production Changes</h3>
<p>In response to the decrease auto ownership, home-based (HB) trip-making decreased by a total of 299 trips or 0.2% from 146,328 to 146,029.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-motorized-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Motorized Changes</h3>
<p>Despite the overall decrease in trip-making, there was a small increase in HB non-motorized trips, but the increase was only 35 trips (0.12% in the area affected). The increase in transit and non-motorized HB trips also led to an increase of 17 non-motorized NHB trips, for a total increase of 52 non-motorized trips.</p>
</div>
<div id="mode-choice-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Mode Choice Changes</h3>
<p>Despite the overall decrease in HB trips, there was an increase of 234 transit trips or an increase in transit mode share in the affected zones from 0.7% to 0.9%. Between the decrease in trip-making and shift to transit, HB auto trips decreased by 528.</p>
</div>
<div id="nhb-trip-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>NHB Trip Changes</h3>
<p>The increase in transit HB trips and decrease in auto HB trips resulted in concomitant changes in non-home-based (NHB) trips. NHB auto trips decreased by 208, while NHB transit trips increased by 186.</p>
</div>
<div id="transit-assignment-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Transit Assignment Changes</h3>
<p>From the above it can be seen that total transit trips increased by 420. The difference of 89 trips from the total route ridership of 509 were thus the result of shifts in existing transit trips from other routes to the new route.</p>
</div>
<div id="highway-assignment-changes-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Highway Assignment Changes</h3>
<p>The decreased auto trips resulted in a decrease of 4,436 VMT (0.01% of the regional total), 111 VHT (0.01% of the regional total), and 14 less vehicle hours of delay (0.03%). As can be seen in the following map the decreases are focused around the new bus route corridor, particularly on Leesville Rd. on which the new route runs but also decreasing parallel route US 70. Even with a relative gap of 0.00001, there is still evidence of noise in the assignment convergence at this small scale (changes of less than 500 vpd), seen primarily in downtown Raleigh. That said, the real project impacts dominate the assignment results, and the model appears to be appropriately sensitive even at this fine scale.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/BusHwyAssignment.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pedestrian-infrastructure" class="section level2">
<h2>Pedestrian Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>No Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year</li>
<li>Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year – pedestrian overpass</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, Caliper tested the removal of the pedestrian overpass over I-440 at Yadkin Dr. The model results are reasonable. The largest impact the model predicts is change in destination (at least 43 trips), followed by change in mode (9 trips), followed by change in auto ownership (4 cars), followed by change in trip-making (2 trips).</p>
<div id="walk-accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3>Walk Accessibility</h3>
<p>The map below shows the location of the pedestrian overpass removed, and resulting decreases in Walk Access.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/PedWalkability.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="auto-ownership-changes-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Auto Ownership Changes</h3>
<p>The reductions in walk accessibilities resulted in the model predicting an additional 4 household vehicles, a 0.07% change in the affected zones increasing average automobile ownership in the zones from 1.610 to 1.612 vehicles per household. It is unclear if the addition or removal of a pedestrian overpass would actually result in any change in vehicle ownership, but it may on the margin and the change is small enough and in the correct direction to be plausible.</p>
</div>
<div id="hb-trip-production-changes-2" class="section level3">
<h3>HB Trip Production Changes</h3>
<p>The very small increase in vehicle ownership resulted in a very small increase of two HB trips. This implies that half the time or every other day having an additional car resulted in an additional tour. Even at this micro scale the model’s response seems reasonable.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-motorized-changes-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Motorized Changes</h3>
<p>Although total trips increased by two, total daily HB non-motorized trips decreased by seven and motorized trips increased by nine. Thus, the mode shift was more significant than trip suppression/induction which stands to reason.</p>
</div>
<div id="nhb-trip-changes-2" class="section level3">
<h3>NHB Trip Changes</h3>
<p>The decrease in HB nonmotorized trips led to a further decrease of two NHB nonmotorized trips daily, making the total decrease in non-motorized trips nine. This implies that roughly a quarter of the nonmotorized tours eliminated had more than one stop which seems eminently plausible.</p>
</div>
<div id="destination-choice-changes" class="section level3">
<h3>Destination Choice Changes</h3>
<p>Although the model does not assign non-motorized trips, it is possible to compare the trips between the zones north of I-440 near the pedestrian bridge and those south of I-440 near the pedestrian bridge. It would make sense that many of these trips would use the pedestrian bridge to cross I-440, although given the size of the zones, many of these trips are also likely served by Lassiter Mill Rd. and the Greenway’s crossings.</p>
<p>In the base case there are 253 pedestrian trips crossing I-440 in this vicinity. With the removal of the pedestrian bridge this number decreases to 201. Since only nine of these trips shifted to auto, this implies that the remaining 43 were diverted to destinations on the same side of I-440. It also suggests that in the base case there are at least 52 daily trips on the pedestrian bridge that change either mode or destination to avoid a pedestrian crossing of I-440 without the bridge. However, the total number of trips utilizing the bridge is likely larger in the base case since some of the trips affected by the removal of the pedestrian bridge presumably just change routes and cross instead at Lassiter Mill Rd. or using the Greenway.</p>
<p>In summary, it is possible that the largest impact of removing the pedestrian bridge would be route changes, but without a non-motorized assignment the model cannot tell us. The largest impact the model predicts is change in destination (at least 43 trips), followed by change in mode (9 trips), followed by change in auto ownership (4 cars), followed by change in trip-making (2 trips). This makes sense. The presence or absence of the pedestrian bridge does not have much impact on trip-making. It mainly changes the routes and destinations of people’s non-motorized trips, but a small number of important trips shift to auto and an even smaller number of people on the margin might buy a car.</p>

<h2>Highway Capacity</h2>
<ul>
<li>No Build Scenario: 2016 Base Year</li>
<li>Build Scenario: 2016 Base Year + added travel lanes on I-40</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario Caliper tested adding an additional lane of travel in each direction on I-40 from the Triangle Parkway to Wade Ave and along Wade Ave to I-440.</p>
<p>The model results are reasonable. The increased capacity on I-40 has a meaningful impact on reducing regional delay and decreases regional VHT, but at the cost of some induced VMT. The majority of the induced VMT comes from destination choice where overall resident trip lengths increased by less than two hundredths of a mile. The remainder of the induced VMT was primarily people choosing longer but now faster routes in assignment, with a very small amount of induced VMT from mode shift.</p>

<h3>Assignment Changes</h3>
<p>Route choice in assignment was the primary change in link level volumes, with I-40 attracting more flow and diverting it from competing routes, most notably I-540, but also the Triangle Parkway, NC 54, NC 55, etc. Some facilities feeding I-40 also saw increased volume, most notably I-440 north and east of Wade Ave.</p>

<h3>Destination Choice Changes</h3>
<p>The increased capacity of I-40 does cause a modest shift of destinations, increasing destinations along the corridor and decreasing destinations primarily along competing corridors, most notably the Triangle Parkway, but also I-540. The map below shows the change in AM destinations from the base scenario. The changes ranged from -8.4 to +14.6, but the vast majority of destinations were essentially unchanged. The net effect, however, was an increase in average trip lengths from 7.169 miles in the base to 7.185 in the build scenario since travelers were able to travel further in the same amount of time due to decreased congestion on I-40.</p>

<h2>Parking</h2>
<ul>
<li>No Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year</li>
<li>Build Scenario: 2020 Base Year + reduction in parking capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>In this test, Caliper verified that the model responds appropriately to changes in parking supply. Caliper reduced the parking capacity of zone 1421 from 1800 to 900 spaces. The map below shows the the changes in park and walk trips. The blue zone is zone 1421 with a reduction of 561 trips. Instead, those travelers divert to park in other zones proportional to the number of spaces in them and inversely proportional to how far away they are. Finally, the model kept all parking changes within the same parking district, which is the desired result.</p>
<p><img src="img/sensitivity/parking_pnw_change.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Caliper also checked for changes in mode and destination choice. Neither were affected in any meaningful way by this change. This reduction in capacity was relatively small and didn’t significantly affect the total parking available in downtown Raleigh.</p>
