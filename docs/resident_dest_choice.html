<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This document summarizes the destination choice (DC) models estimated using travel survey and other data from the Triangle region. These models will become a part of the G2 hybrid travel demand model. Within the hybrid framework, destination choice is modeled in the aggregate for each of several trip purposes. Vehicle sufficiency and income are used to further refine the market segments.</p>
<p>General modeling aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destinations are predicted at the zone (TAZ) level.</li>
<li>Based on an analysis of the region, the zones were logically grouped into the following clusters:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/dc/clusters.png" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Nested Logit (NL) models were estimated for the home-based trip purposes while multinomial logit (MNL) models were estimated for non-home-based trip purposes. NL models were attempted for the latter set of purposes but did not provide justifiably better models.</li>
<li>All models were estimated using Larch (Newman, 2021).</li>
</ul>
<div id="a-note-on-model-fit" class="section level3">
<h3>A note on model fit</h3>
<p>While the fit of a discrete choice model is popularly assessed through the rho-squared and asymptotic rho-squared statistics, they are tricky to interpret in the context of destination choice. The presence of the size term complicates the calculation of the base log-likelihood, LL(0), which forms the reference for the rho-squared calculation. LL(0) is based on the assumption that all alternatives are equally likely. However, the zone alternatives in destination choice are not truly elemental alternatives but are themselves rather the collection of individual employment (say) options available within that zone. The size variable with its default coefficient of 1 must therefore be included when determining LL(0). This provides an automatic “improvement” of LL(0) over the case where the size variable is not included. Consequently, rho-squared falls. This should not be taken as automatic evidence of a poorer model. The selection of the model should still (as always) be based on the reasonableness of its coefficients, their statistical significance, and model sensitivities.</p>
</div>
<div id="distance-terms" class="section level3">
<h3>Distance terms</h3>
<p>Destination choice models in practice sometimes include distance and its mathematical transforms as part of each zone’s utility equation. While these terms might improve statistical fit, they can cause unintended sensitivities that are counter-intuitive. These effects stem from the non-monotonic shape of the combined distance effect, as illustrated by the example below. Taken from a real-world model, this graph clearly shows how farther zones are less attractive only up to a certain threshold. Beyond that distance, the effect is reversed so that the farthest zones become more attractive (all else being the same).</p>
<p><img src="img/dc/distance_poly.png" width="115%" height="115%" /></p>
<p>Such models only remain valid for the range of distances observed in the survey data used for model estimation. Scenarios involving longer distances will produce unintuitive model sensitivities.</p>
<p>Another concern with distance variables is their static nature. Since they are not responsive to congestion, they cannot capture destination choice sensitivity to this key real-world and policy-relevant aspect.</p>
<p>In addition, distance is highly correlated with travel times so that the inclusion of both variables often causes difficulties in model estimation as the algorithm struggles to uniquely split the effects between them.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the destination choice models for TRM rely on travel times, logsums by mode type, and other skims rather than distance-based variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="home-based-trips" class="section level2">
<h2>Home-Based Trips</h2>
<p>The TRM region features eight home-based trip purposes as revealed by an analysis of the survey. Each purpose’s destination choice model is based on nested logit with zone clusters as nests. Each cluster has its constituent zones under it:</p>
<p><img src="img/dc/model_structure.png" width="115%" height="115%" /></p>
<p>Various model structures and specifications were tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>FLAT: No nesting</li>
<li>SEQUENTIAL CHOICE OF CLUSTER + WITHIN-CLUSTER ZONE
<ul>
<li>Sub-model approach 1: Separate sub-model for each cluster</li>
<li>Sub-model approach 2: Common model across all clusters (with appropriate availabilities)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NESTED (simultaneous choice of cluster and zone)</li>
</ul>
<p>The nested specification outperformed all other approaches.</p>
<div id="w_hb_w" class="section level3">
<h3>W_HB_W</h3>
<p>W_HB_W corresponds to trips that are part of a work tour, have one end at home, and the other end at work. This segment captures trips that directly connect the home and work locations and translates to the HBW trip purpose in traditional models. Destination choice in this context relates to the long-term decision of work location, to which work trips are made with regularity.</p>
<div id="survey-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Survey data</h4>
<ul>
<li>Records: trip_type = “W_HB_W_All”</li>
<li>Sample size: 3,662</li>

</div>
<div id="notes" class="section level4">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>ASCs were estimated for all but one of the clusters. Several of them had values close to zero with poor significance. These were dropped and only the significant ones were retained. These ASCs are very small in magnitude, confirming that the model’s explanatory power is derived from other variables with the ability to capture location choice behavior.</li>
<li>Intrazonal effects are strong.</li>
<li>Home cluster effects are also strong, with residents of Cary, Durham, Chapel Hill, Garner often living and working in the same cluster. Similar effects are also true for the peripheral clusters toward the northeast and south.</li>
<li>Mode choice logsums are significant for workers from zero-auto households, capturing a coupling with access to public transit modes.</li>
<li>Using mode choice logsums for the other auto sufficiency markets (with or without the presence of congested time) caused unrealistic signs as well as much poorer model fit. This can be explained by the fact that these logsums are primarily driven by auto skims, which are already a part of the utility equation.</li>
<li>Hospitals being a major source of employment in the region, accessibility to hospital jobs helps drive work destination attractiveness. Transit and walk accessibilities are also drivers of a zone’s attractiveness for work tours.</li>
<li>The cluster nest coefficients are mostly significantly different from 1, so the nested structure is justified. Research Triangle Park is a special cluster (very low residential land use, very high technology employment, etc.) and has an MNL-type sub-nest.</li>
<li>The size variables are stratified by income. The percentage of low and high paying jobs in each zone was used to split the total attraction into income-specific attractions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="double-constraint-and-attraction-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Double constraint and attraction model</h4>
<p>All trip types other than work are singly-constrained. This means that the row sums of the resulting trip table will match starting productions, but column sums will not necessarily be proportional to the amount of employment in each zone. As an example, for two zones with the same employment, the more accessible zone will attract more trips.</p>
<p>For work trips, a traditional assumption to make is that each job of the same type must attract the same work trips - even if the zone is in a remote location. The justification for this assumption has weakened in recent years with the rise in telecommuting, flex schedules, and other changes, but the TRMG2 model implements double constraint for work trips. In the context of destination choice models, this is achieved by assigning each zone a “shadow price”. This extra term in the utility equation is adjusted in an iterative fashion to match predicted attractions.</p>
<p>These predicted attractions come from a regression model estimated from the survey data.</p>

<p>During model application, predicted attractions are always scaled to match predicted productions to match double constraint. As a consequence, the attraction model should predict total attractions that is close to predicted productions. This is referred to as PA balance (“production/attraction balance”).</p>
<p>The coefficients in the table above were multiplied by 2.45 during model calibration to achieve the appropriate PA balance of 1.0. If the ratio is too high or too low, adding additional employment to a zone will have unexpectedly high or low impact on trips attracted (given the scaling that must be done to attractions).</p>

<h3>W_HB_O</h3>
<p>W_HB_O corresponds to trips that are part of a work tour, have one end at home, and the other end at a non-work location. This segment captures trips that directly connect the home to an intermediate stop on the way to or from work and translates to the HBO trip purpose in traditional models. Destination choice in this context relates to a short-term decision of intermediate stop location.</p>

<ul>
<li>ASCs were estimated for all but one of the clusters. Several of them had values close to zero with poor significance. These were dropped and only the significant ones were retained. These ASCs are very small in magnitude, confirming that the model’s explanatory power is derived from other variables with the ability to capture location choice behavior.</li>
<li>Intrazonal effects are strong.</li>
<li>Travel time is more important up to the first 30 minutes. Excess time beyond this threshold is perceived as being less onerous.</li>
<li>Home cluster effects are also strong, with residents of Cary, Garner, Raleigh, Southern Durham and the southeastern periphery often stopping in the same cluster for their intermediate stops.</li>
<li>The public transit mode choice logsum is significant.</li>
<li>The number of households is a major factor in the calculation of the size variable, reflecting the inclusion of personal visits in this trip purpose. Logically, the retail and service employment also help drive trips to specific destinations. Income-based stratifications of employment did not make a difference.</li>
<li>The cluster nest coefficients are mostly significantly different from 1, so the nested structure is justified. Research Triangle Park is a special cluster (very low residential land use, very high technology employment, etc.) and has a nearly MNL-type sub-nest.</li>

<h2>Non-Home-Based trips</h2>
<p>The non-home-based trip purposes are multinomial logit (MNL) specifications. Though the cluster-based nested structure of the home-based purposes was not adopted, cluster-level alternative-specific constants (ASCs) are included to help capture cluster-level preferences.</p>
<p>The non-home-based trip purposes consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work tours
<ul>
<li>W_NH_EK12</li>
<li>W_NH_O</li>
<li>W_NH_WR</li>

<li>N_NH_O</li>

<p>Given the strong dependence of destination choice on the prior home-based trip’s travel mode for non-home-based trips, separate destination choice models have been estimated by mode. For simplicity and statistical efficiency of model estimation, the above trip purposes were combined into the following four categories that combine trip purpose with travel mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>NHB Work Tours by Auto</li>
<li>NHB Non-work Tours by Auto</li>
<li>NHB Tours by Public Transit</li>
